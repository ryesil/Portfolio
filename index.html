            My name is Ramazan Yesil. I am working at MMSA. I am interested in
            Coding. I know Java, SQL, and JavaScript so far. I am planning to
            learn more. I am also a team player.

          <h2>Hobbies</h2>
          <p>
            My biggest hobby is learning coding. I love learning a new coding
            language. It seems to be a challenge of solving a puzzle for me. I
            love math and coding as if was born out of math. That's why it
            attracts me to itself. Apart from that, I also like biking,
            swimming, watching Netflix, and jogging.

          <p>
            My most important skill is perseverance. I don't easily give up. I
            do my best to become good at what I am doing as long as there is
            excitement in it. I am also a fast learner. I konw myself and how to
            study. I think knowing how to study is also a good treat. I am a
            humble person. I don't look at people from above. I belive everyone
            is like a book. And you can always learn something from people as
            long as you do not pre-judge them by just looking at them.
